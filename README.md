## Overview
Eportfolio is a personal or institutional portfolio platform designed to **showcase work, achievements, and skills**.  
It can be used by students, professionals, and organizations to present projects, CVs, and digital credentials in a clean and customizable way.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
This project requires:
- **Programming Language:** PHP (8.1 or later recommended)
- **Package Manager:** [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)

### Installation
To build and run `Eportfolio` from source:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bkyalo/eportfolio
````

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd eportfolio
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies (via Composer):**

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

### Usage

Run the project using:

```bash
php {entrypoint}
```

> Replace `{entrypoint}` with the main PHP file (e.g., `artisan serve` or `index.php`, depending on setup).

### Testing

Eportfolio uses **{test\_framework}** (e.g., PHPUnit).
Run the test suite with:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Would you like me to:

1. **Fill in placeholders** (`{entrypoint}` and `{test_framework}`) assuming it’s a **Laravel app**?  
2. Or **keep it generic** so the file works for any PHP project?  
3. Or **make two versions** (generic + Laravel-specific)? Which one do you prefer?
```
